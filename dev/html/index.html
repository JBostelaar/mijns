					<p>As we approach the coldest months of the year, Copenhagen-based photographers Jesper Palermo and Matias Molina visit Iceland to capture the country’s incredible nature.</p>
					<p>Driving around in a 4WD Toyota and equipped with the latest gear from Swedish brand Haglöfs, the two shot some of the Nordic island’s lesser known spots, as well as abandoned locales, before taking in one of Iceland’s most stunning phenomenons: the aurora borealis, better known as the Northern lights.</p>

					<p>In 2014, Copenhagen-based photographer Bobby Anwar took off to the Faroe Islands to find some peace away from city madness. No people, no rush, no hassle. Then this November, Bobby set off once again for the remote, North Atlantic island chain, this time aiming to experience the beautiful landscape in winter. Already familiar with the lay of the land from his last trip, Bobby hit the road on his first day, departing straight from the airport towards the well-known waterfall Gásadalur, before heading to the capital city of Torshavn.</p>

					<p>In means of taking the viewer on a magical exploration throughout the breathtaking island of Iceland, a pair of filmmakers studying Audiovisual Media at the Stuttgart Media University in Germany present Iceland 4K. The clip, which runs just under seven minutes and was captured using an ARRI AMIRA and a Canon 5D Mark III, highlights the immense beauty that Iceland’s stunning landscape and coinciding wildlife have to offer.</p>

					<p>Ever attend a massive warehouse rave and think how anyone could possibly top it? Well this year’s Secret Solstice Festival certainly will be, as they plan to host the world’s very first party within a glacier as part of the festival’s extended off-site bespoke celebrations. Limited to only 70 guests, the once in a lifetime experience will take place inside Langjökull – Europe’s second-largest glacier – located in the wilder outskirts of Reykjavík, Iceland. The lucky guests will be some of the first people on Earth to descend into a man-made cave system beneath ice up to 580m thick.</p>
